# gdg-logo-animated
We try to create an animated version of the 2013 GDG t-shirt logo.

[!GDG Logo](/../master/design/gdg_5_elements.png?raw=true)


With this we can create cool stuff:

- A live wallpaper for Android
- A watchface for Android Wear
- A presentation placeholder with music (as background presentation for I/O Extended and more)
- you tell us :)
